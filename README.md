Hot-Restart for Dart console application with fast incremental compilation.

## Why do I need this?

If your console application compiles too long before running seems too slow.

## Install

Use the dart pub global command to install this into your system.

```console
$ dart pub global activate fire
```

## Use

If you have [modified your PATH][path], you can run this from any local directory.

```console
$ fire
```

Otherwise you can use the `dart pub global` command.

```console
$ dart pub global run fire
```

Here's an example of running a console application:

```console
$ fire bin/cat.dart example/example.dart
> watching 'lib' folder.
> compiling done, took 0:00:00.000054
void main() {
  print('hello cat!');
}

> press r to restart and q to exit.
```

While running creates `bin/cat.dill` incremental kernel snapshot.

## ToDo

* Hot-Reload with Flutter like `reassemble` (if possible)
* `build_runner` integration (if possible, or alternative solution)
* AOT compilation, [it's impossible for now](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/47322)
